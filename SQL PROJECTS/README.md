This folder contains all the projects that I made using SQL :-

Below is a brief of what these projects are about:-

## 1. STUDENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS :-
This project is a basic SQL-driven analysis of student performance data focused on understanding patterns through segmentation rather than forced correlations. Using MS SQL Server, the analysis explores how study hours, attendance, grades, and score distributions relate to overall performance. Since the dataset is highly synthetic and evenly balanced, demographic variables offered little insight, so the focus shifted to grade-wise, distribution-based, and percentile-based patterns. Although the project is introductory in nature, it provided a strong lesson in data quality assessment and the importance of adapting analytical approaches to the nature of the data rather than the analyst’s expectations.
